# If set to On, tilde expansion is performed when readline attempts word completion.
set expand-tilde off

# If set to On, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is, it will not strip the
# high bit from the characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims it
# can support. The name 'meta-flag' is a synonym for this variable.
set input-meta on

# If set to On, readline will display characters with the eighth bit set directly
# rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.
set output-meta on

# This  alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If set to on, words
# which have more than one possible completion cause the matches to be listed immediately
# instead of ringing the bell.
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# If set to On, a character denoting a file's type as reported by stat(2) is appended
# to the filename when listing possible completions.

# Commands for Moving {{{
#
#   beginning-of-line (C-a)

#
#   end-of-line (C-e)
#     Move to the end of the line.
#
#   forward-char (C-f)

#
#   backward-char (C-b)
#     Move back a character.
#
#   forward-word (M-f)

#     alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).
#
#   backward-word (M-b)
#     Move back to the start of the current or previous word.  Words are
#     composed of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).

# Commands for Manipulating the History {{{
#
#   beginning-of-history (M-<)
#     Move to the first line in the history.
#
#   end-of-history (M->)

#
#   history-search-forward
#     Search forward through the history for the string of characters between the

#
#   history-search-backward
#     Search backward through the history for the string of characters between the
#     start of the current line and the point.  This is a non-incremental search.

# Commands for Changing Text {{{
#
#   delete-char (C-d)
#     Delete the character at point.  If point is at the beginning of
#     the line, there are no characters in the line, and the last character
#     typed was not bound to delete-char, then return EOF.
#
#   quoted-insert (C-q, C-v)
#     Add the next character typed to the line verbatim.  This is how
#     to insert characters like C-q, for example.
#
#   tab-insert (C-v TAB)
#     Insert a tab character.
